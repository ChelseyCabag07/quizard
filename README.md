# Quizard

Quizard is a lightweight Spring Boot application that parses study materials (DOCX/PDF/TXT), generates quizzes and flashcards, and stores quiz attempts and reviewers. It is intended as a small backend for building quiz/flashcard web frontends.

## Key Features

- Parse uploaded study files (DOCX, PDF, TXT) to extract questions/answers and reviewer content.
- Generate quizzes using multiple strategies (multiple choice, identification, enumeration, etc.).
- Create and manage flashcards based on parsed content.
- Persist quiz attempts and reviewer information using Spring Data JPA.
- Simple authentication and authorization scaffolding.
- CORS configuration to allow local front-end testing.

## High-level Architecture

- Spring Boot application (entry point: `com.teamdebug.quizard.QuizardApplication`).
- Controllers handle HTTP requests and delegate to services:
  - `AuthController` — authentication endpoints
  - `QuizController` — quiz generation and attempt endpoints
  - `ReviewerController` — upload and manage reviewer content
  - `HelloController` — example/test endpoint
- Services implement business logic:
  - `QuizGeneratorService` — generates quizzes using multiple generator strategies
  - `FlashcardService` — create/manage flashcards
  - `SummaryService` — summarization utilities
  - Parsers in `service.parser` (`DocxParser`, `PdfParser`, `TxtParser`) to read uploaded files
- Repositories persist domain entities (Flashcard, QuizItem, QuizAttempt, Reviewer, User)

## Workflows

- Upload & Parse Reviewer File
  1. Client uploads a reviewer file (DOCX/PDF/TXT) to the reviewer upload endpoint.
  2. Server selects the appropriate parser and extracts question/answer pairs and reviewer notes.
  3. Extracted data is stored as `Reviewer` (and optionally `Flashcard`/`QuizItem`).

- Generate Quiz
  1. Client requests quiz generation via the quiz endpoint with parameters (type, size, etc.).
  2. `QuizGeneratorService` picks a generator strategy (multiple choice, identification, enumeration) and builds a quiz.
  3. Quiz items are returned to the client, and attempts can be saved to the `QuizAttempt` repository.

- Create Flashcards
  1. Flashcards can be generated from parsed reviewer content or created manually via API.
  2. `FlashcardService` persists flashcards and supports retrieval for study sessions.

- Authentication
  - Basic auth controller and DTOs are provided. Use the authentication endpoints to register/login and obtain any tokens or session data the app expects.

## Configuration

- Default database: in-memory H2 during development (configured by Spring Boot auto-configuration).
- CORS is configured in `com.teamdebug.quizard.config.CorsConfig` to allow `http://127.0.0.1:5500` and `http://localhost:5500` (useful for local front-end testing)

## Building and Running

Requirements:
- Java 17
- Maven (the project includes the Maven Wrapper)

Build and run locally:

```powershell
./mvnw.cmd clean package
./mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

Run tests:

```powershell
./mvnw.cmd test
```

The application will start on the default Spring Boot port (8080) unless overridden in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

## Project Structure (high level)

- `src/main/java/com/teamdebug/quizard` — application sources
  - `config/` — configuration (CORS, security, file upload)
  - `controller/` — REST controllers
  - `model/` — DTOs and domain entities
  - `repository/` — Spring Data repositories
  - `service/` — business logic and parsers
- `src/test/java` — unit/integration tests

## Notes & Next Steps

- Consider adding a Postgres/MySQL profile for production instead of the in-memory H2 DB.
- Add API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger) for clearer client integration.
- Add GitHub Actions to run `mvn test` on push (I can add a workflow if you want).

If you'd like, I can also:
- Add a minimal `README` badge matrix or CI workflow
- Generate OpenAPI docs and serve Swagger UI
- Add example curl requests for key endpoints
